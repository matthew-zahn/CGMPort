    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper uses a realistically calibrated model of consumption and portfolio choice with non-tradable assets and borrowing constraints and finds that the optimal share invested in equities decreases over the agent's life span. The author's also examine the importance of human capital for investment behavior as well as the implications of introducing endogenous borrowing constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main findings are summarized below. \n",
    "- The shape of the income profile over the life span induces investors to reduce proportional stock holdings when aging, which rationalizes the advice from the popular finance literature. \n",
    "- Labor income that is uncorrelated with equity returns is perceived as a closer substitute for risk free asset holdings than equities. Thus, the presence of labor income increases the demand for stocks, particularly earlier in an investor's life. \n",
    "- Even small risks to employment income have a significant effect on investing behavior. Author's describe it has a \"crowding\" out effect that is particularly strong for younger households. \n",
    "- The lower bound of the income distribution is very relevant to understanding borrowing capacity and portfolio allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook summarizes the setup and calibration of the model. \n",

    "__Time parameters and preferences__ \n",
    "\n",
    "An investorâ€™s age is denoted as $t$ and they live for a maximum of $T$ periods. The investor works for the first $K$ periods of their life, where $K$ is assumed to be exogenous and deterministic. The probability that an investor alive in period $t$ is alive in $t+1$ is $p_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Investor $i$ has the following time separable utility function:\n",

    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\delta<1$ is the discount factor, $C_{it}$ is the level of consumption in period $t$, $\\gamma>0$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and $D_{it}$ is the level of wealth that the investor bequeaths to descendants upon their death. Bequests are governed by the same the utility as the one from living consumption. The parameter $b$ controls the intensity of the bequest motive.\n",

    "__Labor income__\n",
    "\n",
    "Before retiring, investor $i$ at age $t$ learns labor income $Y_{it}$, which is exogenously given by:\n",

    "where $u_{it}$ is distributed according to $N(0,\\sigma^2_u)$ and is independent of $\\epsilon_{it}$. Pre-retirement log income is the sum of a deterministic component calibrated to capture the hump-shaped profile observed in the data. The author's take $v_t$ as a random walk and assume that $\\epsilon_{it}$ is uncorrelated across households. The permanent component can be decomposed into an aggregate component $\\xi_t$ with the distribution $N(0,\\sigma^2_\\xi)$ and an idiosyncratic component $\\omega_{it}$ (distributed by $N(0,\\sigma^2_\\omega)$):\n",

    "### Investor's problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In each period $t$ the investor faces the following problem. They start off with wealth $W_{it}$ and then realize their labor income $Y_{it}$. Cash on hand is defined as $X_{it} = W_{it} + Y_{it}$. Then the investor must decide how much to consume $C_{it}$ and how to allocated their savings between stocks and Treasury bills. Next period's wealth is given by:\n",

    "__Labor income process__\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSID is used to estimate the labor income equation and its permanent component. This estimation controls for family specific fixed effects. In order to control for education, the sample was split into three groups: no high school, high school but no college degree, and college graduates. Across each of these groups, $f(t,Z_{it})$ is assumed to be additively separable across its arguments. The vector of personal characteristics $Z_{it}$ includes age, household fixed effects, marital status, household size/composition. The sample uses households that have a head between the age of 20 and 65. For the retirement stage, $\\lambda$ is calibrated as the ratio of the average of labor income in a given education group to the average labor income in the last year of work before retirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error structure of the labor income process is estimated by following the variance decomposition method described in Carroll and Samwick (1997). A similar method is used to estimate the correlation parameter $\\rho$. Define $r_{id}$ as:\n",

    "Adults start at age 20 without a college degree and age 22 with a college degree. The retirement age is 65 for all households. The investor will die for sure if they reach age 100. Prior to this age, survival probabilities come from the mortality tables published by the National Center for Health Statistics. The discount factor $\\delta$ is calibrated to be $0.96$ and the coefficient of relative risk aversion ($\\gamma$) is set to $10$. The mean equity premium $\\mu$ is $4%$, the risk free rate is $2%$, and the standard deviation of innovations to the risky asset is set to the historical value of $0.157$.\n",

    "## Core Results\n",
    "\n",
    "__Baseline model__\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the baseline model contextualize the results in the popular finance literature. Early in life, agent's invest fully in stocks and hit their borrowing constraints. In midlife as retirement comes closer, agent's begin to save more and invests more in the risk-free asset. Finally, in retirement the portfolio rule shifts in and wealth runs down quickly. This leads to an increase in holdings of risky assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Labor income risk: Income risk may vary across employment sectors relative to the baseline model. The author's examine extreme cases for industries that have a standard deviation and temporary income shocks. While some differences appear across sectors, the results are generally in line with the baseline model.\n",
    "- Disastrous labor income shocks: The author's find that even a small probability of zero labor income lowers the optimal portfolio allocation in stocks, while the qualitative features of the baseline model are preserved.\n",
    "- Uncertain retirement income: The author's consider two types of uncertainty for retirement income; it is stochastic and correlated with current stock market performance and allowing for disastrous labor income draws before retirement. The first extension has results essentially the same as the baseline case. The second leads to more conservative portfolio allocations but is broadly consistent with the model.\n",
    "- Endogenous borrowing constraints: The author's add borrowing to their model by building on credit-market imperfections. The author's find that the average investor borrows about \\$5,000 and are in debt for most of their working life. They eventually pay off this debt and save for retirement. Relative to the benchmark model, the investor has put less of their money in their portfolio and arrive at retirement with substantially less wealth. These results are particularly pronounced at the lower end of the income distribution relative to the higher end. Additional details are available in the text.\n",
    "- Bequest motive: The author's introduce a bequest motive into the agent's utility function (i.e., $b>0$). Young investors are more impatient and tend to save less for bequests. As the agent ages, savings increases and is strongest once the agent is retired. This leads to effects on the agent's portfolio allocation. Taking a step-back however, these effects are not very large unless $b$ is large. \n",
    "- Educational attainment: The author's generally find that savings are consistent across education groups. They note that for a given age, the importance of future income is increasing with education level. This implies that riskless asset holdings are larger for these households. \n",
    "- Risk aversion and intertemporal substitution: Lowering the level of risk aversion in the model leads to changes in the optimal portfolio allocation and wealth accumulation. Less risk-averse investors accumulate less precautionary savings and invest more in risky assets.\n",
