## Description

This repository corresponds to the [Final assignment](https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/Methods/blob/master/Assignments/14_Final-Class-Project/Final-Class-Project.md) of the course Advanced Macroeconomics I at Johns Hopkins University, by Professor Christopher D. Carroll.

We upload our entire work environment to show we replicated the framework exemplified by the [Buffer Stock Theory](https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/BufferStockTheory-make) paper to our best ability, as required. However, most users will find all the materials relevant to them in the folder CGMPort-Shared (or CGMPort-Public).

## Location of main files:
1. A notebook attempting to replicate the paper's main results using HARK can be found at [<tt>CGMPort-Public/Code/Python/CGM_REMARK.ipynb</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/blob/master/CGMPort-Public/Code/Python/CGM_REMARK.ipynb).

1. A document going into more detail on our attempt to replicate can be found at [<tt>CGMPort-Public/CGMPort.pdf</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/blob/master/CGMPort-Public/CGMPort.pdf).

1. The code that generates all the figures and results in the previous document can be found at [<tt>CGMPort-Public/Code/Python</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/tree/master/CGMPort-Public/Code/Python). Files can be run independently, or all at once through the script [<tt>CGMPort-Public/Code/Python/do_ALL</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/blob/master/CGMPort-Public/Code/Python/do_ALL.py).

1. The original Fortran 90 code made available by the authors can be found in [<tt>CGMPort-Public/Code/Fortran</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/tree/master/CGMPort-Public/Code/Fortran).

1. A bash script that produces all the results and generates all the documents can be found in [<tt>CGMPort-make/doEverything.sh</tt>](https://github.com/matthew-zahn/CGMPort/blob/master/CGMPort-make/doEverything.sh).
